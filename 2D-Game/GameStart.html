                        is press the up arrow to go up, and press the down arrow to go down. There is a catch however. The catch is that the player 
                    will need to touch the ground in order to reset their boost, otherwise the player will be trapped on the ground and the game will end. </font></center></h6>

                    <h6><center><font color="white">1. This week I decided to create a video game that anyone can play and enjoy. I also created a start page too for the game 
                                                        that outlines how to play. (this is the page that you are currently on)
                    </font></center></h6>
                    <h6><center><font color="white">2. I enjoyed the creative process of making a video game that is fully playable
                                                        and I also enjoy the accomplished feeling of making a video game to call my own. </font></center></h6>

                    <h6><center><font color="white">3. I was frustrated by the fact that the code does not work, meaning that I need to back through all the code 
                                                        to find out where my error is and then to fix that error. </font></center></h6>

                    <h6><center><font color="white">4. Overall, I feel like my creation is put together really well, it has great functionality and not to mention 
                                                        people can use it and have a ton of fun. I am also extremely proud of creating my first game too, 
                                                        I have never done this before and being able to tell people that I have made my own playable video game is something great to share.  </font></center></h6>
